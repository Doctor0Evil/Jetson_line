# Jetson_line
The Jetson_Line is a biophysical simulation-framework, using neuro.print! with Rust to understand human-society at a smaller-scale, and learn for education on how-to develop solutions to save the earth. The framework, also, shows the importance of media, and outreach in human-society, and shows promise-tree decisions if we safely adapt-with tech.
